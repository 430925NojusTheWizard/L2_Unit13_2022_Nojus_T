# Images not stretching when zoomed in above 200%

* Note: the cart and user go through the contact button + Phones in the best selling squeeze each other stretching them upwards when in mobile form (i would make the navbar adjust size to fit everything without overlaping, and mobile phones resize when squeezed) <img src= "../img/Mobile-Mode.PNG">

* Note: Images in the "Best Selling Products" stretch when zoomed, Object fit: cover somewhat fixed that by keeping the image consistant but cutting the parts that spill out, currently have no idea how to fix that, i had object fit cover disabled as it cuts off the top and bottom part of nokia 3310

* Note: i would change the other phone specs into table but was pressed on time

* Note: The cards in the product section would have phone descriptions and redirect to their respective pages but was pressed on time
